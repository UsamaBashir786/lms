  <h2>1. Usability</h2>
  <p>
    This category focuses on making the website user-friendly and accessible, ensuring that visitors can easily navigate
    and achieve their goals.
  </p>

  <h3>a. User-Centered Design</h3>
  <p>
    Design the website with the target audience in mind.
    Focus on their needs, preferences, and behavior to create an intuitive experience.</p>
  <h3>b. Navigation</h3>
  <p>
    Provide clear menus, breadcrumbs, and a search bar to help users find information quickly.
    Maintain consistent navigation across pages for ease of use.</p>
  <h3>c. Accessibility</h3>
  <p>
    Ensure the website is usable by people with disabilities (e.g., screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation).
    Follow accessibility guidelines like WCAG to make content perceivable and operable.</p>
  <h3>d. Feedback and Interaction</h3>
  <p>
    Provide immediate feedback when users interact (e.g., hover effects, form validation messages).
    Highlight errors and success states to guide users effectively.</p>
  <h3>e. Testing and Feedback</h3>
  <p>
    Conduct usability testing to identify pain points and improve functionality.
    Use analytics and user feedback for ongoing improvements.</p>

  <h2>2. Aesthetics</h2>
  This category emphasizes the visual and design elements that make the website appealing and engaging.

  <h3>a. Visual Hierarchy</h3>
  <p>
    Use size, color, and positioning to prioritize elements (e.g., headings, CTAs).
    Guide the user's eye through a logical flow using design patterns like the F-pattern or Z-pattern.</p>
  <h3>b. Consistency</h3>
  <p>
    Maintain a uniform design language across the website, including colors, fonts, and button styles.
    Ensure consistent interaction elements (e.g., hover effects, transitions) across all pages.</p>
  <h3>c. Simplicity</h3>
  <p>
    Avoid overwhelming the user with excessive visuals or content.
    Stick to a minimalist approach with a focus on essential elements.</p>
  <h3>d. Typography</h3>
  <p>
    Choose readable fonts with appropriate sizes and spacing.
    Use a clear hierarchy for headings, subheadings, and body text to enhance scannability.</p>
  <h3>e. Color Theory</h3>
  <p> Use complementary colors that align with your brand identity and evoke the desired emotions.
    Ensure high contrast between text and background for readability.</p>
  <h3>f. Whitespace</h3>
  <p>
    Include negative space around elements to reduce clutter.
    Use whitespace strategically to draw attention to key components like CTAs or headings.</p>
  <h2>3. Functionality</h2>
  This category ensures the website performs efficiently, adapts to various devices, and meets the intended
  objectives.

  <h3> a. Responsiveness</h3>
  <p>Design for a seamless experience across devices, from desktops to smartphones.
    Use flexible grids and media queries to ensure layouts adapt properly.</p>
  <h3>b. Performance</h3>
  <p>
    Optimize images, scripts, and stylesheets to minimize load times.
    Use caching and compression to improve page speed for repeat visitors.</p>
  <h3>c. Content Quality</h3>
  <p>
    Provide engaging, concise, and relevant content tailored to your audience's needs.
    Structure content for SEO to improve visibility in search engines.</p>
  <h3>d. Call-to-Action (CTA)</h3>
  <p>
    Make CTAs (e.g., "Sign Up," "Buy Now") prominent and compelling.
    Position CTAs strategically where users are likely to see them, like above the fold or at the end of content.
